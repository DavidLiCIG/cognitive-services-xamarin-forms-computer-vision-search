# Sample - Visual Search App with Cognitive Services

This sample illustrates how the [Azure Computer Vision API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/computer-vision/) and [Bing Web Search API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/bing-web-search-api/) can be used together to build a simple visual search application.  

## The Sample
This sample is a Xamarin.Forms application which uses the Bing Computer Vision and Bing Web Search RESTful APIs to parse text from images and then query that text on Bing.  It can import photos or capture them with the OS-default camera on Android, iOS, or the Universal Windows Platform.  


### Build the sample
1. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select `File > Open >
    Project/Solution`.
    
2. Navigate to the folder where you cloned the repository.

3. Double-click the Visual Studio 2015 Solution (.sln) file
    SpeechToText-WPF-Sample.
